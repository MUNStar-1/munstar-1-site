					MUNStar-1 has been established to support student learning in communications principles and space systems through Memorial University's Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science. One of the focal points of MUNStar-1 is promoting enthusiasm in amateur radio use, which is synergistic with Communications Principles courses taught at the faculty. Course content offered through Memorial University is relevant in the context of providing preparation to any amateur radio courses taken by the students. The MUNStar-1 design team actively promotes course offerings made through Radio Amateurs Canada for students to obtain their Amateur Radio Operator Certificate. Memorial is also in partnership with the IEEE Student Branch to offer free amateur radio training and an opportunity to obtain the Amateur Radio Operator Certification.
